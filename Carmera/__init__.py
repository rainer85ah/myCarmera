"""
To test your basic software development skills we would like you to create a simple application that uses our API to
create thumbnails. The application shall:

    Use the API to search for images captured 7 days ago in the East Village
    Download those images
    Resize each image to 640 width, maintaining the aspect ratio
    Send an HTTP ping to www.carmera.co signaling completion for each image

Optionally, the application may also perform other operations such as:

    Perform a Computer Vision detection or classification task
    Detect whether or not the image is blurry, dark, or occluded
    Anything else you find interesting

You can find API documentation at http://docs.api.carmera.co/.
Your API key is 00bc11acbd9c2690eb453a51b335bbcdd8652ba9
You can also use are data explorer tool at http://beta.carmera.co/.  (pw carmeratest1141)

You may use any language you like, although python or node are preferred. Code should be clear, concise,
be well documented, and use best practices. Imagine this code is being integrated into a larger team-built application.
Bonus points for unit tests.

You may use the following longitude, latitude pairs to define the East Village:

[-73.987084387429,40.7330731785852],
[-73.9806062564698,40.7303859498055],
[-73.9862746210592,40.7225563969032],
[-73.9922222154312,40.7243339978445],
[-73.9910494503437,40.7275293277755],
[-73.987084387429,40.7330731785852]
